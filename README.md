### Introduction

This project was first created as a practical for the FreeCodeCamp HTML/CSS Course. It was made to solidify my knowledge of both HTML and CSS.  
I then went ahead and made it more interesting by adding a bit of JavaScript. This will be a website where I can showcase all my future projects.

### Technologies

* HTML5 version:

To do:
